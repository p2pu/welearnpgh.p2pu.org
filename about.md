about: >-
  We Learn began as an IMLS-funded partnership between Carnegie Library of
  Pittsburgh (CLP), Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU), Detroit Public Library,
  Multnomah County Library, and Onondaga Free Library. This project builds upon
  the success of P2PU and Chicago Public Library’s learning circles model, and
  aims to increase access to free, high quality social learning opportunities by
  supporting community members to be the leaders.

faq:
  - q: What is We Learn?
    a: >+
      We Learn is social learning that is supported by the library but powered
      by community members.


      We Learn programs involve a group of people who meet to learn something
      together. These programs are:

      - Open to the public

      - Free for participants

      - Recurring 


      These learning groups may be led by a peer facilitator, a fellow community
      member, or a person who has special skills or knowledge. In any instance,
      the programs are meant to be flexible and to fit into each participants’
      life experience.. 

  - q: What personal information do I need to provide to participate?
    a: >
      We Learn facilitators use resources created by P2PU to manage
      registration, advertise programs, and community members, and keep in touch
      with participants.


      Participants do not need to create an account with Peer 2 Peer University.
      You can sign up for a learning circle with your name and phone number
      and/or email address. This information is only used by your facilitator to
      contact you. If you would like to create a learning circle, then you need
      to create a P2PU account. Additional questions related to user privacy can
      be answered by contacting support@p2pu.org.
