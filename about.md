about: >-
  We Learn began as an IMLS-funded partnership between Carnegie Library of
  Pittsburgh (CLP), Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU), Detroit Public Library,
  Multnomah County Library, and Onondaga Free Library. This project builds upon
  the success of P2PU and Chicago Public Library’s learning circles model, and
  aims to increase access to free, high quality social learning opportunities by
  supporting community members to be the leaders.

faq_title: Frequently asked questions
faq:
  - q: What is a learning circle?
    a: >
      A learning circle is a group of people who meet to learn something
      together. Learning circles are:

      - Open to the public

      - Free for participants

      - Recurring (generally between 6-8 times)


      Additionally, learning circles are led by a facilitator, rather than a
      teacher. This means that the person who is organizing your learning circle
      is not an expert in the subject that you are learning. They are there to
      help guide the group through the course and ensure that the meeting space
      is ready each week.
  - q: What learning materials can be used in learning circles?
    a: >
      Most learning circles use a free, online course as the basis of study.
      While P2PU creates some courses, the vast majority of materials come from
      other organizations around the web. You are welcome to use any course you
      would like for a learning circle, so long as it is free for participants
      and not in violation of the terms of service of the course provider. A
      complete list of courses currently being used by learning circle
      facilitators is available at https://www.p2pu.org/courses/
  - q: What personal information do I need to provide to participate?
    a: >
      Learning circle participants do not need to create an account with Peer 2
      Peer University. You can sign up for a learning circle with your name and
      phone number and/or email address. This information is only used by your
      facilitator to contact you. If you would like to create a learning circle,
      then you need to create a P2PU account. Additional questions related to
      user privacy can be answered by contacting support@p2pu.org.
  - q: Does it cost money to participate in a learning circle?
    a: 'No, learning circles are free to participate in.'
  - q: Do I get any certificate at the end of the learning circle?
    a: >-
      P2PU is not a university and does not offer any accredited degree
      certificates. Some of the online courses that are used in learning circles
      have degree and/or certificates, but many of these are not free. If you
      would like a certificate demonstrating the completion of your learning
      circle, this is possible if you speak with your facilitator.
  - q: What is Peer 2 Peer University?
    a: >-
      P2PU is a 501c3 non-profit organization registered in California in the
      United States, with team members in the US, Canada, and South Africa. The
      mission of the organization is to create equitable, empowering, and
      liberating alternatives to mainstream higher education. The majority of
      funding for P2PU comes from philanthropic and public sources including
      Institute of Museum and Library Services, Open Society Foundations, Siegel
      Family Endowment, and Knight Foundation. P2PU also accepts donations and
      offers a variety of services to organizations that are looking to develop
      thriving nonformal education communities.
  - q: Who funds this project?
    a: >
      This project is supported by the European Union Erasmus+ program.
      “Learning circles in libraries is a 3-year project (2018-2021) led by
      Fundacja Rozwoju Społeczeństwa Informacyjnego in Poland, with additional
      partners in Germany (Stadtbibliothek Kőln), Romania (Fundatia Progress),
      Portugal (Biblioteca Lucio Craveiro da Silva), and Finland (Suomen
      eOppimiskeskus ry).


      The aim of the project is to facilitate access to useful online learning
      resources for adults using the learning circle methodology developed by
      P2PU. Together we are:


      - Conducting background research in 2018-19, including writing a white
      paper on adult learning and scanning for high quality online learning
      resources in each partner’s language.

      - Translating and adapting the learning circle methodology and software in
      2019-20.

      - Training up to 25 learning circle organizers in 2020, who will lead
      facilitation workshops in each country.

      - Running a series of facilitation training workshops 2021, leading to
      learning circles happening in libraries across each of the partner
      countries.
  - q: Can anybody start and facilitate a learning circle?
    a: >
      Yes! Learning circles are free to create, all you need is an account with
      P2PU. We have begun to create some [LANGUAGE]-language resources for
      facilitators, which you can view and contribute to [here](/facilitate)
